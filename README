TVBR is a set of tools for streaming DVB-T & DVB-S tv/radios over UDP/IP.
Those tools are:
	tvbr: a dvb multicast streaming server
	tvbr-unicast-*: a multicast-udp-stream to unicast-http gateway
	dump_udp: an UDP dumper
	dump_sap: an SAP dumper
	relay: a multicast-udp to unicast/multicast-udp relay


===
===	tvbr
===
tvbr is the main tool of this packages.
You'll find informations on how to configure 'tvbr' in docs/CONFIG.tvbr,
docs/channels.conf-example and docs/streams.conf-example.

tvbr' main usage is the streaming of multiple channels on a campus network.

Features:
	Stream transponder from 1 to 6 DVB-T or DVB-S cards, with multiple channels on each transponder
	One ip/port pair for each stream
	Auto-dispatching of streams on DVB cards (based on compatibility of the transponder of each stream)
	SAP announcement of streams (with SAP cancellation packets on termination)
	Three set of possible "mandatory pids" to send (all/minimal/none)
	PMT-Filtering (in order to avoid sending bandwidth-consuming PMT stream advertising non-streamed channels)
	Smart reload of config file on SIGHUP (only restarting streams modified by the new configuration)

Usage: tvbr [-hvq] [-d <path/to/etc>] [-c <card>[,<card>[...]]] <hostname>
	-v		Increase verbosity
	-q		Decrease verbosity
	-d <path>	Config dir (with streams.conf and channels.conf)
	-c		List of DVB cards to use (default: each card can be used by tvbr)
	<hostname>	'hostname' to use when parsing streams.conf

===
===	tvbr-unicast
===
tvbr-unicast is a one-way relay from UDP-multicast streams to http (hence unicast) streams.
tvbr-unicast-client and tvbr-unicast-server communicate through an Unix socket.

tvbr-unicast-client is the CGI client, executed by Apache (or any other compatible http daemon)
tvbr-unicast-server is the authorization server which enforce the bandwidth policy


IPC (docs/tvbr-unicast-ipc.php) is a PHP Class implementing the client/server IPC
can be used to provide a dynamic information page, whose content depends on the host IP (see
docs/tvbr-unicast-podcast.php, which provides an XML podcast with only the streams allowed for
the IP requesting the page).

Features:
	Offers udp-multicast streams in unicast (useful for multicast-incompatible parts of the network)
	Offering only allowed streams on a per-IP basis
	Enforcing bandwidth policy on a per-IP / per-network basis

Usage: tvbr-server [-hvq] -c <path/to/config>
	-v		Increase verbosity
	-q		Decrease verbosity
	-c <file>	Configuration file (see docs/CONFIG.unicast)
	-d		Disconnect the old streaming process before accepting a new streaming from the same IP
			(workaround of an Apache process)

Apache config snippet:
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^/stream/ /home/tv/bin/tvbr-unicast-client [L]
	<Directory /home/tv/bin>
		Order deny,allow
		Deny from all
		Allow from 111.222.333.444
		Options +ExecCGI
		SetHandler cgi-script
	</Directory>

	This config will enable the unicast gateway only for 111.222.333.444. The mapping will done on path "/stream/"
	(/stream/ is a *mandatory* choice; you must otherwise change src/tvbr-unicast-client.c).

===
=== dump_udp, dump_sap, relay
===
dump_udp is a UDP-multicast stream dumper
dump_sap is a SAP dumper (output in csv/zsv/php 'serialize'/xml formats)
relay is an UDP-multicast relay (multicast->multicast or multicast->unicast)
